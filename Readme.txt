Code was developed on Mac OS X 10.8 using TextWrangler and compiled with g++.

Wesley To performed the submission.

The assignment is not complete. We had much trouble with linking the separate cpp files, and had to eventually add all the code into a single file, RayTrace.cpp. As such, we didn't have enough time to work out the actual kinks in our code.
